I truly find myself very fortunate to working with some really smart people out there in tech and Open source domain. My interests include the development of free & open source software, computer security, cryptography, network protocols, distributed systems, software architecture, and programming languages. I particularly enjoy building highly distributed systems using functional programming languages, and low-level systems programming.I am not particularly good at keeping this website up-to-date, but you should be able to find information on how to contact me.\n    I love learning and building new stuff and work with other people as nothing really interesting is ever built alone :) When I am not in front of my laptop ,you'll find me playing football or reading books.I love to read and always have.Fiction being my most favourite genre,I also recently started writing blogs on some of my most treasured books on Medium ,the link of which you can see somewhere on the screen. I also used to love dogs until I discovered cats because the smallest feline is a masterpiece.

We cannot imagine a life without Whatsapp, Telegram, Hike, etc. I was always curious about their working, so I spent some time and learnt about their theory of implementation. Equipped with the right knowledge I have created a very basic implementation of instant messengers. Though this is very basic, probably it might seem like app of MS-DOS era. But the functionality present in it is very similar to the current IM app, it can connect to a client through a server and send messages to other client.","link":"https://github.com/Kushal-kothari/Chat-server-and-Client"},{"name":"Pathfinder-visualizer","description":"Pathfinding visualizer algorithm Program to visualize working of BFS and DFS and how they explore nodes.
